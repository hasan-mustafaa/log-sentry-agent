# LogSentry Agent

> AI-driven AIOps system that monitors simulated microservice logs and metrics, detects anomalies using ML, diagnoses root causes with a ReAct LLM agent, and automatically remediates issues.

---

## Overview

LogSentry Agent is a self-healing observability pipeline built for simulated FCT (Financial Crime & Technology) microservices. It combines traditional statistical methods with modern ML and LLM-powered reasoning to detect, diagnose, and remediate operational incidents — all without human intervention.

**Core capabilities:**
- Real-time structured log generation across 4 interdependent microservices
- Fault injection (crashes, latency spikes, memory leaks, connection failures)
- Hybrid anomaly detection (Z-score + Isolation Forest ensemble)
- LLM-based root cause analysis via the ReAct reasoning pattern
- Automated remediation with safety guardrails
- Live Streamlit dashboard with agent reasoning traces

## Architecture

Full system design: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

![LogSentry Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

The pipeline has five stages:

| Stage | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Simulator** | Generates metrics + logs for 4 FCT services; injects faults |
| 2 | **Detection** | Z-score + Isolation Forest ensemble; scores anomalies 0-1 |
| 3 | **Agent** | ReAct LLM loop (Observe → Think → Act → RCA report) |
| 4 | **Remediation** | Executes actions against simulator with safety guardrails |
| 5 | **Dashboard** | Live Streamlit UI reading from shared JSON state file |

## AI Techniques

| Technique | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Drain Algorithm** | `src/detection/log_parser.py` | Mines structured templates from raw log lines |
| **Z-Score Detection** | `src/detection/statistical_detector.py` | Per-metric rolling baseline anomaly detection |
| **Isolation Forest** | `src/detection/ml_detector.py` | Multivariate ML anomaly detection per service |
| **Ensemble Scoring** | `src/detection/feature_extractor.py` | `0.4 x stat + 0.6 x ML`, triggers at score >= 0.5 |
| **ReAct Agent** | `src/agent/react_agent.py` | Observe → Think → Act LLM reasoning loop |
| **LLM RCA** | `src/agent/prompts.py` | Structured root cause report with confidence score |
| **Safety Guardrails** | `src/remediation/guardrails.py` | Restart limits, cooldown, auto-escalation |

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- An OpenAI API key 

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd log-sentry-agent

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Configuration

All tuneable parameters are in `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
simulator:
  metrics_interval_seconds: 5   # tick rate

detection:
  z_score_threshold: 3.0        # statistical sensitivity
  ensemble_weights:
    statistical: 0.4
    ml: 0.6

agent:
  llm_provider: "openai"        # or "anthropic"
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  max_reasoning_steps: 5

remediation:
  max_restarts_per_service: 3
  restart_cooldown_seconds: 300
```

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Start the detection + agent + remediation pipeline
python -m src.main

# Dry-run mode (logs actions without executing them)
python -m src.main --dry-run
```

### Running the Dashboard

In a separate terminal:

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 2 seconds.

## How It Works

1. The **Simulator** generates structured JSON logs and time-series metrics for 4 FCT microservices every 5 seconds.
2. The **FaultInjector** injects realistic faults (crashes, latency spikes, memory leaks, connection failures) that cascade upstream through the dependency graph.
3. The **LogParser** (Drain algorithm) extracts log templates and computes error rate features.
4. The **FeatureExtractor** builds time-windowed multivariate feature vectors from metric snapshots.
5. The **Ensemble Detector** (Z-score + Isolation Forest) scores each window and triggers on score >= 0.5.
6. On anomaly detection, the **ReAct Agent** is invoked with the full anomaly context including triggered metrics and recent logs.
7. The Agent iterates Observe → Think → Act (up to 5 steps), reasoning over the service dependency graph to identify root cause.
8. The **Executor** applies the chosen action (restart, scale, rollback, alert) with guardrail safety checks before execution.
9. The **Dashboard** reflects all state changes in real time via a shared JSON state file written after every tick.

## Assumptions & Future Improvements

See [ASSUMPTIONS.md](ASSUMPTIONS.md) for a full list of assumptions, known limitations, and planned improvements.

**Key assumptions:**
- All microservices are simulated in-process (no real containers or network)
- Isolation Forest is trained once during warm-up and not retrained
- Single LLM provider per run (no fallback)

**Planned improvements:**
- Online model retraining for concept drift
- Kubernetes and PagerDuty integration for real remediation
- Multi-agent parallelism for concurrent incident handling
- Persistent incident memory across agent runs
